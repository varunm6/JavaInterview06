Introduction to Java:
History of Java:
Java was developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems (now 
owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s.
It was originally designed for programming consumer electronic devices, but its 
focus shifted towards internet programming.
Java's development was influenced by the need for a platform-independent 
language that could run on various devices and operating systems.
The first version of Java, Java 1.0, was released in 1996.
Java Features and Benefits:
Simple and easy to learn: Java has a straightforward syntax and a rich set of 
libraries, making it accessible for beginners.
Object-oriented: Java follows an object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, 
allowing for modular and reusable code.
Platform independence: Java programs can run on any platform with a Java 
Virtual Machine (JVM), making them highly portable.
Robust and secure: Java includes features like garbage collection and built-in 
exception handling, ensuring reliable and secure code.
Java Final Notes 5
Rich API: Java provides a vast standard library (API) for various tasks, from 
input/output operations to networking and database access.
Multithreading: Java supports concurrent programming with built-in thread 
management, allowing for efficient utilization of system resources.
High performance: Java's Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and optimized runtime 
make it a high-performance language.
Java Virtual Machine (JVM):
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an integral part of the Java platform and acts 
as an execution environment for Java programs.
It provides a layer of abstraction between the Java code and the underlying 
operating system.
JVM interprets compiled Java bytecode and translates it into machine code 
specific to the host system.
It handles memory management, garbage collection, and runtime optimizations 
for efficient execution of Java programs.
JVM implementations are available for various platforms, allowing Java 
programs to run consistently across different systems.
Java Development Kit (JDK):
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment that 
provides tools, libraries, and documentation for Java development.
It includes the Java compiler (javac) to compile Java source code into bytecode.
JDK also contains the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which includes the 
JVM and necessary libraries to run Java applications.
Developers use the JDK to write, compile, and debug Java programs.
It is available in different versions, with each version introducing new features 
and improvements.
Getting Started with Java:
To start programming in Java, you need to install the Java Development Kit 
(JDK) on your system.
Once installed, you can use a text editor or Integrated Development 
Environment (IDE) to write Java code.
Java Final Notes 6
Java programs are structured into classes, where each class represents a 
blueprint for objects.
A simple "Hello, World!" program in Java looks like this:
public class HelloWorld { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    } 
} 
In this example, we define a class named "HelloWorld" with a "main" method.
The "main" method is the entry point of the program, and it prints the string 
"Hello, World!" to the console using the System.out.println  statement.
To run the Java program, you need to compile it using the javac  command, and 
then execute it using the java  command.
Java Fundamentals:
Variables and Data Types:
Variables are used to store data in memory during program execution. In Java, 
you need to declare a variable before using it.
Java supports various data types, including primitive types (int, double, boolean) 
and reference types (String, arrays, objects).
Primitive data types in Java are categorized into four groups: integer types, 
floating-point types, character type, and boolean type.
Examples of variable declaration and initialization:
int age; // variable declaration 
age = 25; // variable initialization 
 
double salary = 50000.0; // variable declaration and initialization 
 
boolean isStudent = true; // variable declaration and initialization 
 
String name = "John"; // variable declaration and initialization 
Operators and Expressions:
Java Final Notes 7
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. Java 
supports a wide range of operators, including arithmetic, assignment, 
comparison, logical, and more.
Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, % (modulus)
Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=
Comparison operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
Logical operators: && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)
Example expressions:
int x = 10; 
int y = 5; 
int sum = x + y; // arithmetic operation 
 
boolean isTrue = (x > y) && (x != 0); // logical operation 
Control Flow Statements (if-else, switch, loops):
Control flow statements are used to control the execution flow of a program 
based on certain conditions or repetitive tasks.
If-else statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on a 
condition.
Switch statements are used for multi-way branching based on different cases.
Loops (for, while, do-while) enable you to repeatedly execute a block of code.
int age = 18; 
 
if (age >= 18) { 
    System.out.println("You are eligible to vote."); // executed if the condition is t
rue 
} else { 
    System.out.println("You are not eligible to vote."); // executed if the condition
 is false 
} 
 
int day = 2; 
String dayName; 
 
switch (day) { 
    case 1: 
        dayName = "Monday"; 
        break; 
    case 2: 
Java Final Notes 8
        dayName = "Tuesday"; 
        break; 
    default: 
        dayName = "Unknown"; 
} 
 
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { 
    System.out.println(i); // executes the loop body 5 times 
} 
 
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; 
for (int num : numbers) { 
    System.out.println(num); // iterates over the array elements 
} 
Arrays:
Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same data type in a single 
variable.
Arrays have a fixed size, determined at the time of declaration.
Example array declaration and initialization:
int[] numbers = new int[5]; // declaration with size 
numbers[0] = 1; // assigning values to array elements 
numbers[1] = 2; 
numbers[2] = 3; 
numbers[3] = 4; 
numbers[4] = 5; 
 
String[] names = {"John", "Alice", "Bob"}; // declaration with initialization 
 
int length = numbers.length; // accessing the length of the array 
Strings:
Strings in Java are objects that represent a sequence of characters.
Strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified once created.
String manipulation and operations are performed using various methods 
provided by the
String class.
Example string operations:
String name = "John"; 
int length = name.length(); // gets the length of the string 
Java Final Notes 9
 
char firstChar = name.charAt(0); // gets the first character of the string 
 
String upperCaseName = name.toUpperCase(); // converts the string to uppercase 
 
boolean containsA = name.contains("a"); // checks if the string contains a specific su
bstring 
 
String concatenated = name + " Doe"; // concatenates two strings 
 
String formatted = String.format("Hello, %s!", name); // formats a string using placeh
olders 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 
Concepts:
Classes and Objects:
Classes are the blueprint or template for creating objects in Java.
Objects are instances of a class that represent real-world entities or concepts.
Classes define the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects 
of that class can have.
Example of class definition and object instantiation:
// Class definition 
public class Car { 
    // Instance variables 
    private String make; 
    private String model; 
    private int year; 
 
    // Constructor 
    public Car(String make, String model, int year) { 
        this.make = make; 
        this.model = model; 
        this.year = year; 
    } 
 
    // Instance method 
    public void startEngine() { 
        System.out.println("Engine started."); 
    } 
} 
 
// Object instantiation 
Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2022); 
Java Final Notes 10
Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (instance variables) and methods 
that operate on that data within a class.
It provides data hiding and protects the internal state of objects from direct 
manipulation.
Access to the data is typically controlled through getter and setter methods.
Example of encapsulation:
public class BankAccount { 
    private double balance; 
 
    public double getBalance() { 
        return balance; 
    } 
 
    public void deposit(double amount) { 
        // Perform necessary checks and update balance 
    } 
 
    public void withdraw(double amount) { 
        // Perform necessary checks and update balance 
    } 
} 
 
BankAccount account = new BankAccount(); 
double balance = account.getBalance(); // Accessing the balance through a getter metho
d 
account.deposit(1000); // Updating the balance through a method 
Inheritance:
Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and 
behaviors from another class.
The class that inherits is called the subclass or derived class, and the class 
being inherited from is called the superclass or base class.
Subclasses can extend or override the inherited members and also add new 
members.
Example of inheritance:
public class Shape { 
    protected int x; 
    protected int y; 
 
Java Final Notes 11
    public Shape(int x, int y) { 
        this.x = x; 
        this.y = y; 
    } 
 
    public void draw() { 
        System.out.println("Drawing shape at (" + x + ", " + y + ")"); 
    } 
} 
 
public class Circle extends Shape { 
    private int radius; 
 
    public Circle(int x, int y, int radius) { 
        super(x, y); 
        this.radius = radius; 
    } 
 
    @Override 
    public void draw() { 
        System.out.println("Drawing circle at (" + x + ", " + y + ") with radius " + r
adius); 
    } 
} 
 
Circle circle = new Circle(5, 5, 10); 
circle.draw(); // Call to overridden method in the Circle class 
Polymorphism:
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a 
common superclass.
It enables the use of a single interface to represent different implementations.
Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.
Example of polymorphism:
public class Animal { 
    public void makeSound() { 
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound."); 
    } 
} 
 
public class Cat extends Animal { 
    @Override 
    public void makeSound() { 
        System.out.println("Meow!"); 
    } 
} 
 
public class Dog extends Animal { 
    @Override 
Java Final Notes 12
    public void makeSound() { 
        System.out.println("Woof!"); 
    } 
} 
 
Animal cat = new Cat(); 
Animal dog = new Dog(); 
 
cat.makeSound(); // Polymorphic call to makeSound method of Cat 
 
 class 
dog.makeSound(); // Polymorphic call to makeSound method of Dog class 
Abstraction:
Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them 
down into manageable and understandable components.
It focuses on the essential properties and behaviors of an object while hiding the 
unnecessary details.
Abstract classes and interfaces are used to achieve abstraction in Java.
Example of abstraction using an abstract class:
public abstract class Shape { 
    protected int x; 
    protected int y; 
 
    public Shape(int x, int y) { 
        this.x = x; 
        this.y = y; 
    } 
 
    public abstract void draw(); 
} 
 
public class Circle extends Shape { 
    private int radius; 
 
    public Circle(int x, int y, int radius) { 
        super(x, y); 
        this.radius = radius; 
    } 
 
    @Override 
    public void draw() { 
        System.out.println("Drawing circle at (" + x + ", " + y + ") with radius " + r
adius); 
    } 
} 
 
Java Final Notes 13
Shape shape = new Circle(5, 5, 10); 
shape.draw(); // Polymorphic call to the draw method of Circle class 
Interfaces:
Interfaces define a contract or a set of methods that a class must implement.
They provide a way to achieve multiple inheritance and enable loose coupling 
between classes.
Classes implement interfaces using the implements  keyword.
Example of interfaces:
public interface Drawable { 
    void draw(); 
} 
 
public class Circle implements Drawable { 
    private int radius; 
 
    public Circle(int radius) { 
        this.radius = radius; 
    } 
 
    @Override 
    public void draw() { 
        System.out.println("Drawing circle with radius " + radius); 
    } 
} 
 
Drawable drawable = new Circle(10); 
drawable.draw(); // Polymorphic call to the draw method of Circle class 
Packages:
Packages are used to organize classes into a hierarchical structure and avoid 
naming conflicts.
They provide a way to group related classes and provide access control.
Packages are declared at the beginning of Java source files using the package  
keyword.
Example of packages:
package com.company.project; 
 
public class MyClass { 
Java Final Notes 14
    // Class code goes here 
} 
Exception Handling:
Introduction to Exceptions:
Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt 
the normal flow of code.
They represent errors, exceptional conditions, or unexpected situations that 
need to be handled.
Exceptions can occur due to various reasons, such as invalid input, resource 
unavailability, or programming errors.
Handling Exceptions (try-catch, finally):
Exception handling allows us to gracefully handle exceptions and provide 
alternative flows in case of errors.
The try-catch block is used to catch and handle exceptions.
The code that may throw an exception is placed inside the try block.
If an exception occurs within the try block, it is caught and handled in the catch 
block.
The finally block is optional and is executed regardless of whether an exception 
occurs or not.
Example of exception handling:
try { 
    // Code that may throw an exception 
    int result = divide(10, 0); 
    System.out.println("Result: " + result); 
} catch (ArithmeticException ex) { 
    // Exception handling for ArithmeticException 
    System.out.println("Error: " + ex.getMessage()); 
} finally { 
    // Code that will always execute 
    System.out.println("Finally block executed."); 
} 
 
public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) { 
    return dividend / divisor; 
} 
Java Final Notes 15
Checked and Unchecked Exceptions:
Checked exceptions are exceptions that need to be declared in the method 
signature or handled explicitly using try-catch blocks.
Examples of checked exceptions include IOException, SQLException, and 
ClassNotFoundException.
Unchecked exceptions, also known as runtime exceptions, do not require explicit 
handling or declaration.
Examples of unchecked exceptions include NullPointerException, 
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and IllegalArgumentException.
Custom Exception Classes:
In addition to built-in exceptions, you can create your own exception classes by 
extending the Exception class or its subclasses.
Custom exceptions allow you to represent specific application-specific errors or 
exceptional conditions.
Example of a custom exception class:
public class CustomException extends Exception { 
    public CustomException(String message) { 
        super(message); 
    } 
} 
 
public class MyClass { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        try { 
            validateInput(10); 
        } catch (CustomException ex) { 
            System.out.println("Error: " + ex.getMessage()); 
        } 
    } 
 
    public static void validateInput(int value) throws CustomException { 
        if (value < 0) { 
            throw new CustomException("Invalid input: Value cannot be negative."); 
        } 
    } 
} 
In the example above, the CustomException  class extends the Exception  class to 
create a custom exception. The validateInput  method throws the CustomException  if 
the input value is negative, and it is caught and handled in the main  method.
Java Final Notes 16
Java Input/Output (I/O):
Streams and Readers/Writers:
In Java, I/O operations are performed using streams, which provide a convenient 
way to read from or write to a data source.
Streams can be classified into two types: byte streams and character streams.
Byte streams ( InputStream  and OutputStream ) are used for binary data, while 
character streams ( Reader  and Writer ) are used for text data.
Readers and writers are designed to handle character-based data and provide 
methods for reading and writing characters or strings.
Example of reading from a file using BufferedReader :
import java.io.*; 
 
public class ReadFileExample { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("input.txt")))
 { 
            String line; 
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) { 
                System.out.println(line); 
            } 
        } catch (IOException ex) { 
            System.out.println("Error reading file: " + ex.getMessage()); 
        } 
    } 
} 
File I/O:
File I/O operations involve reading from or writing to files on the file system.
The File  class is used to represent files and directories in Java.
File I/O operations are typically performed using byte streams or character 
streams along with file-related classes.
Example of writing to a file using BufferedWriter :
import java.io.*; 
 
public class WriteFileExample { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("output.txt"))) 
{ 
Java Final Notes 17
            writer.write("Hello, World!"); 
            writer.newLine(); 
            writer.write("This is a sample file."); 
        } catch (IOException ex) { 
            System.out.println("Error writing to file: " + ex.getMessage()); 
        } 
    } 
} 
Serialization:
Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream, which can 
be saved to a file or sent over the network.
In Java, serialization is achieved by implementing the Serializable  interface.
The ObjectOutputStream  and ObjectInputStream  classes are used to write and read 
serialized objects, respectively.
Example of serializing an object to a file:
import java.io.*; 
 
public class SerializeExample { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        try (ObjectOutputStream outputStream = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputSt
ream("data.ser"))) { 
            Student student = new Student("John Doe", 25, "Computer Science"); 
            outputStream.writeObject(student); 
            System.out.println("Object serialized."); 
        } catch (IOException ex) { 
            System.out.println("Error serializing object: " + ex.getMessage()); 
        } 
    } 
} 
 
class Student implements Serializable { 
    private String name; 
    private int age; 
    private String major; 
 
    public Student(String name, int age, String major) { 
        this.name = name; 
        this.age = age; 
        this.major = major; 
    } 
 
    // Getters and setters 
} 
Java Final Notes 18
In the example above, the Student  class implements the Serializable  interface, 
allowing its objects to be serialized. The ObjectOutputStream  is used to write the 
serialized object to a file.
Generics:
Introduction to Generics:
Generics in Java provide a way to create reusable code that can work with 
different types.
They allow the definition of classes, interfaces, and methods that can operate on 
parameters of specified types.
Generics enhance type safety and eliminate the need for explicit type casting.
Generics are widely used in collections and algorithms to provide type-safe data 
structures and operations.
Generic Classes:
Generic classes are classes that can work with different types.
They are declared using type parameters, which are specified within angle 
brackets (<>) after the class name.
Type parameters can be used as placeholders for actual types that will be 
provided when creating objects of the generic class.
Example of a generic class:
public class Box<T> { 
    private T value; 
 
    public Box(T value) { 
        this.value = value; 
    } 
 
    public T getValue() { 
        return value; 
    } 
 
    public void setValue(T value) { 
        this.value = value; 
    } 
} 
 
Box<Integer> integerBox = new Box<>(10); // Create a Box object with Integer type 
int value = integerBox.getValue(); // Get the value as an Integer 
Java Final Notes 19
Generic Methods:
Generic methods are methods that can work with different types.
They are declared using type parameters, which are specified within angle 
brackets (<>) before the return type.
Type parameters can be used as placeholders for actual types that will be 
determined at the time of method invocation.
Example of a generic method:
public class ArrayUtils { 
    public static <T> T getFirstElement(T[] array) { 
        if (array != null && array.length > 0) { 
            return array[0]; 
        } 
        return null; 
    } 
} 
 
String[] names = {"John", "Alice", "Bob"}; 
String firstElement = ArrayUtils.getFirstElement(names); // Invoke generic method with 
String type 
Wildcards:
Wildcards are used in generics to provide flexibility in accepting different types.
There are two types of wildcards: the upper bounded wildcard ( <?> ) and the 
lower bounded wildcard ( <? extends T>  or <? super T> ).
The upper bounded wildcard restricts the type to be a specific type or any of its 
subtypes.
The lower bounded wildcard restricts the type to be a specific type or any of its 
supertypes.
Example of using wildcards:
public class NumberUtils { 
    public static double sum(List<? extends Number> numbers) { 
        double total = 0.0; 
        for (Number number : numbers) { 
            total += number.doubleValue(); 
        } 
        return total; 
    } 
} 
Java Final Notes 20
 
List<Integer> integers = List.of(1, 2, 3); 
double sum = NumberUtils.sum(integers); // Invoke method with a List of Integer 
In the example above, the sum  method accepts a list of any type that extends 
Number , allowing it to handle Integer , Double , and other number types.
Collections Framework:
Lists, Sets, and Maps:
The Collections Framework in Java provides a set of interfaces and classes to 
work with collections of objects.
Lists are ordered collections that allow duplicate elements. They maintain the 
order of insertion.
Sets are collections that do not allow duplicate elements. They typically do not 
maintain any specific order.
Maps are key-value pairs, where each element is associated with a unique key.
Example of using lists, sets, and maps:
import java.util.*; 
 
List<String> names = new ArrayList<>(); 
names.add("Alice"); 
names.add("Bob"); 
names.add("Alice"); 
 
Set<Integer> numbers = new HashSet<>(); 
numbers.add(1); 
numbers.add(2); 
numbers.add(1); 
 
Map<String, Integer> ages = new HashMap<>(); 
ages.put("Alice", 25); 
ages.put("Bob", 30); 
ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, TreeMap, etc.:
The Collections Framework provides several concrete implementations of lists, 
sets, and maps.
ArrayList is an implementation of the List interface that uses a dynamic array to 
store elements.
Java Final Notes 21
LinkedList is another implementation of the List interface that uses a doubly-
linked list to store elements.
HashSet is an implementation of the Set interface that uses a hash table to store 
elements. It does not maintain any specific order.
TreeSet is another implementation of the Set interface that stores elements in a 
sorted order.
HashMap is an implementation of the Map interface that uses a hash table to 
store key-value pairs. It does not maintain any specific order.
TreeMap is another implementation of the Map interface that stores key-value 
pairs in a sorted order based on the keys.
Example of using different collections:
import java.util.*; 
 
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(); 
list.add("Alice"); 
list.add("Bob"); 
 
Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(); 
set.add(1); 
set.add(2); 
 
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>(); 
map.put("Alice", 25); 
map.put("Bob", 30); 
Iterators:
Iterators are used to traverse or iterate over the elements of a collection 
sequentially.
The Iterator  interface provides methods like hasNext()  to check if there are 
more elements, and next()  to retrieve the next element.
Example of using an iterator:
List<String> names = List.of("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"); 
 
Iterator<String> iterator = names.iterator(); 
while (iterator.hasNext()) { 
    String name = iterator.next(); 
    System.out.println(name); 
} 
Java Final Notes 22
Sorting and Searching:
The Collections Framework provides utility methods for sorting and searching 
elements in lists.
The Collections  class contains static methods like sort()  to sort lists, and 
binarySearch()  to perform binary search on sorted lists.
Example of sorting and searching:
List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>(List.of(5, 3, 1, 4, 2)); 
 
Collections.sort(numbers); // Sort the list 
 
int index = Collections.binarySearch(numbers, 3); // Perform binary search 
if (index >= 0) { 
    System.out.println("Element found at index " + index); 
} else { 
    System.out.println("Element not found"); 
} 
In the example above, the sort()  method is used to sort the list in ascending order, 
and the binarySearch()  method is used to search for the element 3  in the sorted list.
Multithreading:
Introduction to Threads:
Threads are lightweight units of execution within a program that can run 
concurrently.
Multithreading allows multiple threads to execute in parallel, providing better 
utilization of system resources.
Threads can be used to perform tasks concurrently, handle input/output 
operations, or improve responsiveness in user interfaces.
Creating and Managing Threads:
In Java, threads can be created by extending the Thread  class or implementing 
the Runnable  interface.
Extending the Thread  class requires overriding the run()  method, which 
contains the code to be executed by the thread.
Implementing the Runnable  interface requires implementing the run()  method as 
well, and the Runnable  object can be passed to a Thread  constructor.
Java Final Notes 23
Example of creating and starting a thread:
public class MyThread extends Thread { 
    @Override 
    public void run() { 
        // Code to be executed by the thread 
        System.out.println("Thread is running."); 
    } 
} 
 
public class Main { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        Thread thread = new MyThread(); 
        thread.start(); // Start the thread 
    } 
} 
Synchronization:
Synchronization is used to control access to shared resources or critical sections 
of code in a multithreaded environment.
The synchronized  keyword can be used to mark methods or blocks of code to 
ensure that only one thread can execute them at a time.
Synchronization prevents data races and ensures data consistency.
Example of using synchronization:
public class Counter { 
    private int count; 
 
    public synchronized void increment() { 
        count++; 
    } 
} 
Thread Safety:
Thread safety refers to the property of code or data structures that can be safely 
accessed and manipulated by multiple threads without causing data corruption 
or inconsistencies.
Thread-safe code ensures that shared data is accessed in a synchronized 
manner or by using thread-safe data structures.
Common techniques for achieving thread safety include synchronization, the use 
of atomic operations, and immutability.
Java Final Notes 24
Example of thread-safe code:
public class SafeCounter { 
    private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0); 
 
    public void increment() { 
        count.incrementAndGet(); 
    } 
} 
Thread Communication:
Thread communication allows threads to interact with each other by sharing 
information or coordinating their actions.
Common techniques for thread communication include using shared variables, 
signaling mechanisms like wait()  and notify() , and higher-level constructs like 
Locks  and Conditions .
Example of thread communication using wait()  and notify() :
public class Message { 
    private String content; 
    private boolean available = false; 
 
    public synchronized String receive() { 
        while (!available) { 
            try { 
                wait(); // Wait until a message is available 
            } catch (InterruptedException ex) { 
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); 
            } 
        } 
        available = false; 
        notifyAll(); // Notify waiting threads 
        return content; 
    } 
 
    public synchronized void send(String message) { 
        while (available) { 
            try { 
                wait(); // Wait until the previous message is consumed 
            } catch (InterruptedException ex) { 
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); 
            } 
        } 
        content = message; 
        available = true; 
        notifyAll(); // Notify waiting threads 
    } 
} 
Java Final Notes 25
Thread Pools:
Thread pools are a mechanism for managing and reusing threads in an 
application.
Instead of creating a new thread for each task, a thread pool maintains a pool of 
worker threads that can be used to execute tasks.
Java provides the Executor  framework for managing thread pools, which 
includes classes like ThreadPoolExecutor  and Executors .
Thread pools improve performance by reducing the overhead of
thread creation and destruction.
Example of using a thread pool:
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5); 
 
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { 
    Runnable task = new MyTask(); 
    executor.execute(task); 
} 
 
executor.shutdown(); 
In the example above, a fixed-size thread pool is created using 
Executors.newFixedThreadPool() . Tasks are submitted to the thread pool using the 
execute()  method of the ExecutorService .
Java I/O and Networking:
File Handling:
File handling in Java involves reading from or writing to files on the file system.
The java.io  package provides classes and interfaces for file I/O operations.
Examples of file handling operations include creating, reading, writing, copying, 
and deleting files.
File handling operations can be performed using byte streams ( InputStream , 
OutputStream ) or character streams ( Reader , Writer ).
Example of reading from a file using character streams:
Java Final Notes 26
import java.io.*; 
 
public class FileReaderExample { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("input.txt")))
 { 
            String line; 
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) { 
                System.out.println(line); 
            } 
        } catch (IOException ex) { 
            System.out.println("Error reading file: " + ex.getMessage()); 
        } 
    } 
} 
Streams (Byte Streams and Character Streams):
Streams in Java are used for reading from or writing to a source, such as files, 
network connections, or in-memory buffers.
Byte streams ( InputStream , OutputStream ) are used for binary data, while 
character streams ( Reader , Writer ) are used for text data.
Byte streams provide methods for reading or writing individual bytes or arrays of 
bytes.
Character streams provide methods for reading or writing characters or strings.
Example of writing to a file using byte streams:
import java.io.*; 
 
public class FileOutputStreamExample { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("output.txt")) { 
            String message = "Hello, World!"; 
            byte[] data = message.getBytes(); 
            fos.write(data); 
        } catch (IOException ex) { 
            System.out.println("Error writing to file: " + ex.getMessage()); 
        } 
    } 
} 
Network Programming (TCP/IP, UDP, Sockets):
Network programming in Java involves communication between client and 
server applications over a network.
Java Final Notes 27
Java provides classes and interfaces in the java.net  package for network 
programming.
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) and UDP (User 
Datagram Protocol) are the two main protocols used for network communication.
Sockets are the endpoints for network communication in Java.
Examples of network programming include creating client-server applications, 
sending and receiving data over a network, and establishing socket connections.
Example of a TCP/IP client-server application:
import java.io.*; 
import java.net.*; 
 
// Server 
public class Server { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(1234)) { 
            System.out.println("Server listening on port 1234..."); 
            Socket socket = serverSocket.accept(); 
            System.out.println("Client connected: " + socket.getInetAddress()); 
 
            // Handle client communication 
            // ... 
 
            socket.close(); 
        } catch (IOException ex) { 
            System.out.println("Server error: " + ex.getMessage()); 
        } 
    } 
} 
 
// Client 
public class Client { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        try (Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 1234)) { 
            System.out.println("Connected to server: " + socket.getInetAddress()); 
 
            // Handle server communication 
            // ... 
 
            socket.close(); 
        } catch (IOException ex) { 
            System.out.println("Client error: " + ex.getMessage()); 
        } 
    } 
} 
In the example above, the server listens on port 1234 using a ServerSocket . The 
client connects to the server using a Socket  with the server's IP address and port

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):
Introduction to Databases:
Databases are used to store and manage structured data efficiently.
Databases provide features such as data persistence, data retrieval, data 
manipulation, and data integrity.
Relational databases are the most common type of databases, which organize 
data into tables with rows and columns.
Popular relational database management systems (RDBMS) include MySQL, 
Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.
Connecting to Databases:
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is a Java API for connecting to databases 
and executing SQL queries.
The JDBC API provides a set of interfaces and classes for database 
connectivity.
To connect to a database, you need to load the appropriate JDBC driver and 
establish a connection using a connection string that specifies the database 
URL, username, and password.
Example of connecting to a MySQL database using JDBC:
import java.sql.*; 
 
public class DatabaseConnection { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase"; 
        String username = "root"; 
        String password = "password"; 
 
        try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, passwo
rd)) { 
            System.out.println("Connected to the database!"); 
        } catch (SQLException ex) { 
            System.out.println("Database connection error: " + ex.getMessage()); 
        } 
    } 
} 
Java Final Notes 29
Executing SQL Queries:
Once connected to a database, you can execute SQL queries to retrieve or 
modify data.
The JDBC API provides interfaces such as Statement  and PreparedStatement  for 
executing SQL statements.
Statement  is used for simple SQL queries, while PreparedStatement  is used for 
parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
Example of executing a SELECT query using JDBC:
try (Statement statement = connection.createStatement()) { 
    String query = "SELECT * FROM employees"; 
    ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query); 
 
    while (resultSet.next()) { 
        int id = resultSet.getInt("id"); 
        String name = resultSet.getString("name"); 
        int age = resultSet.getInt("age"); 
        System.out.println("ID: " + id + ", Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age); 
    } 
} catch (SQLException ex) { 
    System.out.println("Query execution error: " + ex.getMessage()); 
} 
Transaction Management:
Transactions ensure the atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) 
properties of database operations.
In JDBC, you can manage transactions using the Connection  object.
By default, JDBC operates in auto-commit mode, where each SQL statement is 
treated as a separate transaction.
To perform multiple SQL statements as a single transaction, you can disable 
auto-commit and explicitly commit or rollback the transaction.
Example of transaction management using JDBC:
try { 
    connection.setAutoCommit(false); 
 
    // Perform multiple SQL statements 
 
    connection.commit(); // Commit the transaction 
} catch (SQLException ex) { 
Java Final Notes 30
    connection.rollback(); // Rollback the transaction 
    System.out.println("Transaction error: " + ex.getMessage()); 
} 
In the example above, the setAutoCommit(false)  method disables auto-commit, 
allowing multiple SQL statements to be executed as a single transaction. If an 
exception occurs, the transaction is rolled back using the rollback()  method.
That covers the brief notes and examples for JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). If 
you have any more topics, please let me know!
Java GUI (Graphical User Interface) 
Programming:
Introduction to Swing:
Swing is a Java GUI toolkit provided by Oracle for building desktop applications.
It offers a rich set of components, such as buttons, labels, text fields, and 
dialogs, for creating interactive user interfaces.
Swing components are lightweight and platform-independent, allowing 
applications to run on different operating systems.
Components (Buttons, Labels, Text Fields, etc.):
Swing provides a wide range of components that can be used to build GUIs.
Common Swing components include buttons, labels, text fields, checkboxes, 
radio buttons, lists, tables, and panels.
Components are added to containers, such as frames or panels, to form the GUI 
layout.
Example of creating and adding components to a JFrame:
import javax.swing.*; 
 
public class MyGUIApp { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("My GUI App"); 
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); 
 
        JLabel label = new JLabel("Welcome to Swing!"); 
        JButton button = new JButton("Click Me"); 
        JTextField textField = new JTextField(); 
 
Java Final Notes 31
        frame.add(label); 
        frame.add(button); 
        frame.add(textField); 
 
        frame.pack(); 
        frame.setVisible(true); 
    } 
} 
Event Handling:
Event handling in Swing allows components to respond to user actions, such as 
button clicks or mouse movements.
Events are generated by user interactions or system actions, and event listeners 
are used to handle these events.
Swing components use the observer design pattern, where listeners are 
registered with components to receive and handle events.
Example of adding an event listener to a button:
button.addActionListener(e -> { 
    // Handle button click event 
    System.out.println("Button clicked!"); 
}); 
Layout Managers:
Layout managers in Swing are used to arrange and position components within 
containers.
They automatically handle the sizing and positioning of components based on 
specified rules.
Common layout managers include FlowLayout , BorderLayout , GridLayout , and 
GridBagLayout .
Layout managers provide flexibility in designing GUIs that can adapt to different 
screen sizes and resolutions.
Example of using a layout manager to arrange components:
import javax.swing.*; 
import java.awt.*; 
 
public class MyGUIApp { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
Java Final Notes 32
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("My GUI App"); 
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); 
 
        JPanel panel = new JPanel(); 
        panel.setLayout(new FlowLayout()); 
 
        JLabel label = new JLabel("Welcome to Swing!"); 
        JButton button = new JButton("Click Me"); 
        JTextField textField = new JTextField(20); 
 
        panel.add(label); 
        panel.add(button); 
        panel.add(textField); 
 
        frame.add(panel); 
        frame.pack(); 
        frame.setVisible(true); 
    } 
} 
In the example above, a JPanel  is used as a container with the FlowLayout  layout 
manager to arrange the components in a horizontal flow.
Java Reflection:
Introduction to Reflection:
Reflection is a powerful feature in Java that allows the inspection and 
manipulation of classes, interfaces, methods, and fields at runtime.
It enables dynamic access to class information and the ability to create, modify, 
or invoke objects and their members dynamically.
Reflection is often used in frameworks, libraries, and tools that require runtime 
analysis or dynamic behavior.
Obtaining Class Information:
The java.lang.Class  class provides methods to obtain information about a class 
at runtime.
Reflection allows you to retrieve information such as class name, superclass, 
implemented interfaces, constructors, methods, and fields.
Example of obtaining class information using reflection:
import java.lang.reflect.*; 
 
public class ReflectionExample { 
Java Final Notes 33
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        Class<Person> personClass = Person.class; 
 
        // Get class name 
        String className = personClass.getName(); 
        System.out.println("Class Name: " + className); 
 
        // Get superclass 
        Class<? super Person> superClass = personClass.getSuperclass(); 
        System.out.println("Superclass: " + superClass.getName()); 
 
        // Get implemented interfaces 
        Class<?>[] interfaces = personClass.getInterfaces(); 
        for (Class<?> intf : interfaces) { 
            System.out.println("Interface: " + intf.getName()); 
        } 
 
        // Get constructors 
        Constructor<?>[] constructors = personClass.getConstructors(); 
        for (Constructor<?> constructor : constructors) { 
            System.out.println("Constructor: " + constructor.getName()); 
        } 
 
        // Get methods 
        Method[] methods = personClass.getMethods(); 
        for (Method method : methods) { 
            System.out.println("Method: " + method.getName()); 
        } 
 
        // Get fields 
        Field[] fields = personClass.getFields(); 
        for (Field field : fields) { 
            System.out.println("Field: " + field.getName()); 
        } 
    } 
} 
 
class Person { 
    private String name; 
    public int age; 
 
    public Person(String name, int age) { 
        this.name = name; 
        this.age = age; 
    } 
 
    public void sayHello() { 
        System.out.println("Hello, I'm " + name); 
    } 
} 
Dynamic Class Loading:
Reflection allows dynamic loading of classes at runtime using the ClassLoader  
class.
Java Final Notes 34
Dynamic class loading enables the loading and instantiation of classes based on 
runtime conditions or configurations.
Example of dynamically loading a class using reflection:
public class DynamicClassLoading { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        try { 
            Class<?> calculatorClass = Class.forName("com.example.Calculator"); 
            Object calculator = calculatorClass.newInstance(); 
 
            Method addMethod = calculatorClass.getMethod("add", int.class, int.class); 
            int result = (int) addMethod.invoke(calculator, 5, 3); 
            System.out.println("Result: " + result); 
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException | InstantiationException | 
                IllegalAccessException | NoSuchMethodException | 
                InvocationTargetException ex) { 
            System.out.println("Error: " + ex.getMessage()); 
        } 
    } 
} 
 
class Calculator { 
    public int add(int a, int b) { 
        return a + b; 
    } 
} 
Accessing and Modifying Objects at Runtime:
Reflection allows you to access and modify the fields and methods of objects 
dynamically at runtime.
You can retrieve field values, set field values, invoke methods, and perform other 
operations on objects using reflection.
Example of accessing and modifying objects at runtime using reflection:
public class ObjectReflection { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        Person person = new Person("John Doe", 25); 
 
        try { 
            Class<?> personClass = person.getClass(); 
 
            // Accessing field values 
            Field 
 
 nameField = personClass.getDeclaredField("name"); 
            nameField.setAccessible(true); 
            String name = (String) nameField.get(person); 
Java Final Notes 35
            System.out.println("Name: " + name); 
 
            // Modifying field values 
            Field ageField = personClass.getDeclaredField("age"); 
            ageField.setAccessible(true); 
            ageField.setInt(person, 30); 
            System.out.println("Modified Age: " + person.age); 
 
            // Invoking methods 
            Method sayHelloMethod = personClass.getDeclaredMethod("sayHello"); 
            sayHelloMethod.setAccessible(true); 
            sayHelloMethod.invoke(person); 
        } catch (NoSuchFieldException | IllegalAccessException | 
                NoSuchMethodException | InvocationTargetException ex) { 
            System.out.println("Error: " + ex.getMessage()); 
        } 
    } 
} 
In the example above, reflection is used to access and modify the private fields of a 
Person  object. The getDeclaredField()  method is used to retrieve the field, and the 
setAccessible()  method is used to allow access to private fields. Similarly, the 
getDeclaredMethod()  method is used to retrieve the method, and the invoke()  method 
is used to invoke the method on the object.
Java 8 Features:
Lambda Expressions:
Lambda expressions introduce a concise syntax for writing anonymous functions 
in Java.
They enable functional programming by treating functions as first-class citizens.
Lambda expressions are commonly used in functional interfaces to represent 
behavior that can be passed as arguments or assigned to variables.
Example of using lambda expressions:
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"); 
 
// Using lambda expression to sort the names 
Collections.sort(names, (a, b) -> a.compareTo(b)); 
 
// Using lambda expression in forEach loop 
names.forEach(name -> System.out.println(name)); 
Functional Interfaces:
Java Final Notes 36
Functional interfaces are interfaces that have a single abstract method.
They are used as the basis for lambda expressions and method references.
Java 8 introduced the java.util.function  package, which provides a set of 
functional interfaces, such as Predicate , Function , and Consumer .
Example of using functional interfaces:
Predicate<Integer> isEven = num -> num % 2 == 0; 
System.out.println(isEven.test(4)); // true 
 
Function<String, Integer> lengthFunc = str -> str.length(); 
int length = lengthFunc.apply("Hello"); // 5 
 
Consumer<String> printUpperCase = str -> System.out.println(str.toUpperCase()); 
printUpperCase.accept("java"); // JAVA 
Stream API:
The Stream API provides a declarative and functional way of processing 
collections of objects.
Streams allow for operations like filtering, mapping, reducing, and collecting on 
collections in a concise manner.
Stream operations can be performed sequentially or in parallel to leverage multi-
core processors.
Example of using the Stream API:
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); 
 
int sum = numbers.stream() 
                .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0) 
                .mapToInt(n -> n * 2) 
                .sum(); 
 
System.out.println(sum); // 12 
Default and Static Methods in Interfaces:
Java 8 introduced default and static methods in interfaces.
Default methods provide a default implementation for interface methods, 
allowing backward compatibility for existing implementations.
Java Final Notes 37
Static methods in interfaces allow utility methods to be defined directly in the 
interface.
Example of default and static methods in interfaces:
interface Vehicle { 
    default void start() { 
        System.out.println("Starting the vehicle..."); 
    } 
 
    static void honk() { 
        System.out.println("Honking the horn!"); 
    } 
} 
 
class Car implements Vehicle { 
    // No need to implement the default start() method 
 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        Car car = new Car(); 
        car.start(); // Default method from Vehicle interface 
        Vehicle.honk(); // Static method from Vehicle interface 
    } 
} 
Date and Time API:
Prior to Java 8, date and time manipulation was done using the java.util.Date  
and java.util.Calendar  classes, which were error-prone and cumbersome.
Java 8 introduced a new Date and Time API ( java.time ) that provides a more 
comprehensive and intuitive way of working with dates, times, and intervals.
The new API includes classes such as LocalDate , LocalTime , LocalDateTime , 
ZonedDateTime , and Duration , among others.
Example of using the Date and Time API:
LocalDate currentDate = LocalDate.now(); 
System.out.println("Current Date: " + currentDate); 
 
LocalTime currentTime = LocalTime.now(); 
System.out.println("Current Time: " + currentTime); 
 
LocalDateTime currentDateTime = LocalDateTime.now(); 
System.out.println("Current Date and Time: " + currentDateTime); 
Java Final Notes 38
Design Patterns:
Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems that occur in software 
design. They provide reusable and well-tested solutions that can help in creating 
flexible, maintainable, and scalable software systems. Here are some commonly 
known design patterns:
Creational Patterns:
Singleton: Ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a 
global point of access to it.
Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses 
decide which class to instantiate.
Abstract Factory: Provides an interface for creating families of related or 
dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
Builder: Separates the construction of complex objects from their representation, 
allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
Prototype: Creates new objects by copying existing objects and modifying them 
as needed.
Structural Patterns:
Adapter: Converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients 
expect, allowing classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.
Decorator: Dynamically adds responsibilities to an object by wrapping it in an 
object of a decorator class.
Composite: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole 
hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions 
uniformly.
Proxy: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access 
to it.
Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier 
to use.
Behavioral Patterns:
Observer: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when 
one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated 
automatically.

Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes 
them interchangeable, allowing algorithms to be selected at runtime.
Template Method: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, allowing 
subclasses to redefine certain steps of the algorithm without changing its 
structure.
Command: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing the parameterization 
of clients with different requests, queues, or log requests, and supports undoable 
operations.
Iterator: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object 
sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
These are just a few examples of design patterns. There are many more design 
patterns available, each addressing different design problems and providing effective 
solutions. It's important to choose the appropriate design pattern based on the 
problem at hand and the specific requirements of the software system.
Remember that design patterns are not strict rules but guidelines that can be 
adapted and modified to suit the specific needs of a project. They help in achieving 
software that is modular, maintainable, and extensible.
Java Best Practices and Coding 
Standards:
Naming Conventions:
Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, methods, classes, and 
packages.
Follow camelCase naming for variables and methods (e.g., firstName , 
calculateTotal ).
Use PascalCase naming for class and interface names (e.g., Customer , 
OrderService ).
Use lowercase for package names (e.g., com.example.myproject ).
Constants should be in uppercase with underscores separating words (e.g., 
MAX_VALUE ).
Code Formatting:
Use consistent indentation (typically 4 spaces) to improve code readability.
Java Final Notes 40
Use braces {}  for control structures and loop bodies, even if they contain a 
single statement.
Limit line length to around 80-120 characters to improve code readability.
Add appropriate whitespace between operators, keywords, and operands to 
improve code readability.
Follow a consistent and logical order for class members (fields, constructors, 
methods).
Exception Handling Best Practices:
Catch specific exceptions rather than using general catch blocks.
Handle exceptions at the appropriate level in the code hierarchy.
Log exceptions or provide meaningful error messages for debugging and 
troubleshooting.
Avoid catching exceptions unless you can handle them appropriately.
Favor checked exceptions for conditions that can be recovered from, and 
unchecked exceptions for fatal or unexpected conditions.
Memory Management:
Properly manage object creation and destruction to prevent memory leaks.
Release resources explicitly when they are no longer needed, such as closing 
files or database connections.
Use try-with-resources or finally blocks to ensure resources are always released, 
even in the presence of exceptions.
Avoid excessive object creation or unnecessary object cloning to conserve 
memory.
Use appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize memory usage.
Performance Optimization:
Profile and benchmark your code to identify performance bottlenecks.
Use efficient algorithms and data structures to optimize time and space 
complexity.
Minimize object creation and unnecessary memory allocation.
Java Final Notes 41
Use appropriate collection types based on the requirements (e.g., ArrayList vs 
LinkedList).
Cache frequently used data or expensive computations, where appropriate.
Use concurrency and parallelism techniques to utilize multi-core processors.
In addition to the above, it's important to follow general best practices such as writing 
modular and reusable code, documenting your code, writing meaningful comments, 
and writing unit tests to ensure code correctness.
Adhering to coding standards and best practices improves code maintainability, 
readability, and collaboration among developers. It also helps in producing high-
quality code that is easier to debug, maintain, and extend.
Remember to also consider any specific coding standards or guidelines provided by 
your organization or development team.
Java Testing and Debugging:
Unit Testing (JUnit):
Unit testing is a fundamental part of software development that ensures 
individual units of code are functioning correctly.
JUnit is a popular testing framework for Java that provides annotations, 
assertions, and test runners to write and execute unit tests.
Write tests that cover different scenarios and edge cases to ensure robust code.
Test methods should be independent, isolated, and repeatable.
Use assertions to validate expected results and behavior.
Use test fixtures and setup methods to prepare the environment for testing.
Organize tests into test suites and test classes for better maintainability.
Example of a simple JUnit test:
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions; 
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; 
 
public class CalculatorTest { 
 
    @Test 
    public void testAddition() { 
Java Final Notes 42
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator(); 
        int result = calculator.add(2, 3); 
        Assertions.assertEquals(5, result); 
    } 
} 
Debugging Techniques and Tools:
Debugging is the process of identifying and resolving issues or bugs in your 
code.
Use print statements or logging to display variable values and trace program 
flow.
Utilize breakpoints to pause code execution at specific lines and inspect 
variables.
Step through the code line by line to understand the execution flow.
Use the debugging tools provided by Integrated Development Environments 
(IDEs) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
Explore features like variable inspection, call stack, watches, and expression 
evaluation in your debugger.
Use conditional breakpoints to break execution only when specific conditions are 
met.
Analyze error messages, exceptions, and stack traces to identify the root cause 
of issues.
Write isolated test cases to reproduce and debug specific problems.
Collaborate with colleagues or use code review tools to get a fresh perspective 
on your code.
Remember to use debugging techniques and tools effectively to diagnose and 
resolve issues efficiently. Understanding the program flow, identifying variables' 
values, and isolating the problem area are crucial in successful debugging.
Introduction to JavaFX:
JavaFX is a Java framework for building desktop applications with rich graphical 
user interfaces (GUIs). It provides a set of libraries and APIs to create interactive 
and visually appealing applications. Here are the key concepts of JavaFX:
JavaFX Basics:
Java Final Notes 43
JavaFX applications are built using a scene graph, which represents the visual 
hierarchy of UI elements.
The entry point of a JavaFX application is the Application  class, which contains 
the start()  method.
The start()  method sets up the primary stage (window) and creates the scene 
graph.
JavaFX applications require the JavaFX runtime environment, which is included 
in the Java Development Kit (JDK) since Java 8.
GUI Components:
JavaFX provides a wide range of GUI components, including buttons, labels, text 
fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, lists, tables, and more.
Components are organized in a hierarchical structure, with the Scene  as the top-
level container and Parent  classes as intermediate containers.
Layout managers, such as VBox , HBox , BorderPane , and GridPane , are used to 
control the positioning and sizing of components within containers.
JavaFX also supports CSS styling for customizing the appearance of 
components.
Event Handling in JavaFX:
Event handling in JavaFX follows the event-driven programming paradigm.
JavaFX provides an event model based on the observer pattern, where event 
sources generate events and event handlers respond to them.
Event sources include GUI components like buttons, mouse clicks, key presses, 
etc.
Event handlers are implemented as event listener interfaces, such as 
EventHandler  and ChangeListener , or using lambda expressions.
Event handling in JavaFX can be done by registering event handlers using the 
setOn<EventName>()  methods or through FXML file bindings.
Example of JavaFX Application: 
Here's a simple JavaFX application that displays a window with a button and handles 
its click event:
import javafx.application.Application; 
import javafx.scene.Scene; 
Java Final Notes 44
import javafx.scene.control.Button; 
import javafx.scene.layout.StackPane; 
import javafx.stage.Stage; 
 
public class HelloWorld extends Application { 
 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        launch(args); 
    } 
 
    @Override 
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) { 
        Button button = new Button("Click Me"); 
        button.setOnAction(event -> System.out.println("Button clicked!")); 
 
        StackPane root = new StackPane(); 
        root.getChildren().add(button); 
 
        Scene scene = new Scene(root, 300, 200); 
 
        primaryStage.setTitle("Hello World"); 
        primaryStage.setScene(scene); 
        primaryStage.show(); 
    } 
} 
In this example, we create a Button  and add an event handler using a lambda 
expression. The button is placed in a StackPane , which is then added to the Scene  of 
the primary stage. Finally, the stage is displayed.
JavaFX offers many more features, including animations, multimedia, charts, and 
CSS styling. It provides a modern and flexible platform for developing desktop 
applications with rich user interfaces.
Note: JavaFX has been decoupled from the core JDK since Java 11 and is now 
available as a separate library. It is recommended to use the latest version of 
JavaFX with the corresponding JDK.
